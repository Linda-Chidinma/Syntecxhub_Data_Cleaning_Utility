# Data Cleaning Utility

This project focuses on cleaning and preparing raw data using Pandas. It was completed as part of the Syntecxhub Virtual Internship program.

## Cleaning Tasks Performed
- Detected and handled missing values using appropriate fill strategies
- Corrected incorrect data types for numeric and date columns
- Parsed inconsistent date formats
- Removed duplicate records
- Standardized column names for consistency
- Exported a cleaned dataset for further analysis

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Summary
A deliberately messy dataset was created within the notebook to simulate real-world data quality issues. The dataset was cleaned step by step, and the final cleaned version was exported for reuse.

## Reflection
This project strengthened my understanding of real-world data cleaning processes and emphasized the importance of preparing clean, reliable datasets before analysis.
